#### When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

#### Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.

#### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
